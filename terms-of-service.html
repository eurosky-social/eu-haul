      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <!-- UPDATE: Replace with your operator name and actual effective date -->
      <p class="effective-date">Operated by: <strong>[Your Name / Organization]</strong> &nbsp;·&nbsp; Effective: [Date]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <strong>Important:</strong> ATProto account migration includes an irreversible step (PLC directory update).
      By using this Service you confirm you understand this and accept these terms.
    </div>

    <h2>1. About This Service</h2>
    <p>
      This account migration service ("<strong>Service</strong>") is provided by
      <!-- UPDATE: Replace with your name/entity -->
      <strong>[Your Name / Organization]</strong> ("<strong>Operator</strong>", "we", "us").
      It allows holders of ATProto / Bluesky accounts to transfer their account from one
      Personal Data Server ("<strong>PDS</strong>") to another using the AT Protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a self-hosted, community tool. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or operated by
      Bluesky PBLLC.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use this Service.
      You must be the legitimate owner of the ATProto account you are migrating, or have explicit authority
      to act on behalf of the account owner.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate credentials for your own account only.</li>
      <li>Do not use this Service to migrate accounts you do not own or are not authorized to migrate.</li>
      <li>Ensure you have a valid invite code (if required by the target PDS) before starting.</li>
      <li>Save your rotation key when displayed — we cannot recover it for you after it is shown.</li>
      <li>Download your backup bundle (if requested) within 24 hours — it is deleted automatically after that.</li>
      <li>Do not attempt to abuse, overload, or interfere with this Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. The Irreversible PLC Update Step</h2>
    <p>
      The migration process includes a step that updates the AT Protocol PLC directory to point your
      Decentralized Identifier (DID) to the new PDS. <strong>This step cannot be undone through this tool.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be shown a rotation key before this step. This key can be used independently of this
      tool to revert the PLC change if needed. You are solely responsible for securely storing this key.
      The Operator accepts no liability for loss of the rotation key or inability to revert a migration.
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>
      THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
      INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. The Operator does not guarantee that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The migration will succeed for every account or PDS combination.</li>
      <li>All blobs (media files) will transfer without error.</li>
      <li>The Service will be available at all times.</li>
      <li>Data on the source or target PDS is preserved beyond what the Operator controls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You are strongly encouraged to create a backup bundle before migrating.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE OPERATOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE
      FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS
      OF DATA, ACCOUNTS, OR CONTENT, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THIS SERVICE,
      EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- UPDATE: Adjust or remove this cap as appropriate for your jurisdiction -->
      The Operator's total liability to you for any claim shall not exceed [€100 / the amount you
      paid to use the Service, if any].
    </p>

    <h2>7. Credential Security</h2>
    <p>
      By submitting your credentials you acknowledge:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your password is transmitted over TLS and encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM).</li>
      <li>Your password is automatically deleted within 48 hours or immediately upon successful migration.</li>
      <li>You should change your password at the source PDS after migration if you have any security concerns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Migrate accounts belonging to others without authorization.</li>
      <li>Attempt to extract other users' credentials or migration data.</li>
      <li>Circumvent rate limits or security measures.</li>
      <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to terminate or block access to the Service for violations of these terms.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Migration involves interaction with third-party services (your source PDS, your target PDS, and
      the AT Protocol PLC directory). The Operator is not responsible for the policies, availability,
      or actions of these third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms at any time. Material changes will be announced on the migration page.
      Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      <!-- UPDATE: Replace with your jurisdiction -->
      These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>[Your Jurisdiction / Country]</strong>,
      without regard to conflict of law principles.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
