## Dedicated Sidekiq process for critical + mailer jobs
#
# This process handles UpdatePlcJob, ActivateAccountJob, and all mailer
# delivery jobs. It ensures time-sensitive jobs (PLC tokens expire in 1h)
# and email delivery are never blocked by long-running blob transfer jobs.
#
# Run with: bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq_critical.yml
