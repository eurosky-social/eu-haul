🔑 HOW TO LOG IN TO YOUR NEW ACCOUNT
================================================================================

If you haven't done so already, log out of your old account in any
Bluesky app, then log in with your new handle:

  Handle: <%= @migration.new_handle %>

  ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Make sure to enter "<%= @migration.new_pds_host %>" as your
  hosting provider at the top of the sign-in form!

Many users miss this step — without the correct hosting provider,
you won't be able to sign in.


================================================================================
🔒 CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD
================================================================================

For your security, we strongly recommend changing your password immediately:

  <%= @migration.new_pds_host %>/.well-known/change-password

You can also change it later in your account settings.


================================================================================

✅ Your old account on <%= @migration.old_pds_host %> has been deactivated
