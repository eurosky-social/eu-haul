PLC CONFIRMATION CODE EXPIRED
==============================

Your migration needs a fresh confirmation code to continue.


YOUR ACCOUNT IS SAFE
=====================

The PLC directory was NOT modified. Your account remains on
<%= @migration.old_pds_host %> and all your migration data
(repository, blobs, preferences) is safely stored and ready.


WHAT HAPPENED?
==============

The confirmation code from your old PDS provider expired before
it could be used. These codes are only valid for a limited time
(typically 1 hour).

<% if @error_message.present? %>
Error Details:
<%= @error_message %>
<% end %>

1. Go to your migration status page (link below)
2. Click "Request New PLC Token" to get a fresh confirmation code
3. Check your email from <%= @migration.old_pds_host %> for the new code
4. Enter the code within 1 hour of receiving it
