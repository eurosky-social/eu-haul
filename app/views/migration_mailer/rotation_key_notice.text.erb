ACTION REQUIRED: CONFIRM YOUR MIGRATION
================================================================================

Your migration is almost done! There is ONE MORE STEP you need to complete.


⚠️  YOU WILL RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION EMAIL
================================================================================

You will shortly receive an email from your OLD PDS provider
(<%= @migration.old_pds_host %>) with the subject line:

    "PLC Update Operation Requested"

That email contains a CONFIRMATION CODE (it looks like XXXXX-XXXXX).

You need to enter this code on your migration status page to finalize
the migration:

    <%= @migration_url %>

IMPORTANT: The confirmation code expires after 1 hour. If you don't see
the email, check your spam folder — it comes from your old PDS provider,
not from us.


================================================================================
🔑 YOUR ACCOUNT RECOVERY KEY
================================================================================

Before the final step, we also want to make sure you have a recovery
key for your account. Think of this as a master password — if you ever
lose access to your account or your server goes down, this key lets
you recover it.

<% if @rotation_key_private.present? %>
Your Recovery Key:
----------------------------------------
<%= @rotation_key_private %>
----------------------------------------

Copy this key and store it somewhere safe — a password manager, a printed
note in a safe place, or an encrypted file. Don't share it with anyone.
<% end %>


WHAT CAN I DO WITH THIS KEY?
================================================================================

If you ever need to recover your account, go to:

    https://pdsmoover.com/restore

and use this key to restore access. It works even if your server is
completely offline.
