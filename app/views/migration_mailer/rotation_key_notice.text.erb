YOUR ACCOUNT RECOVERY KEY
================================================================================

Your migration is almost done! Before we make the final changes to move
your account to the new server, we want to make sure you have a recovery
key for your account.


SAVE THIS KEY NOW
================================================================================

Think of this as a master password for your account. If you ever lose
access to your account or your server goes down, this key lets you
recover it.

<% if @rotation_key_private.present? %>
Your Recovery Key:
----------------------------------------
<%= @rotation_key_private %>
----------------------------------------

Copy this key and store it somewhere safe — a password manager, a printed
note in a safe place, or an encrypted file. Don't share it with anyone.
<% end %>


WHAT CAN I DO WITH THIS KEY?
================================================================================

If you ever need to recover your account, go to:

    https://pdsmoover.com/restore

and use this key to restore access. It works even if your server is
completely offline.


WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
================================================================================

We're now going to update your account to point to the new server
(<%= @migration.new_pds_host %>). This is the final step of your migration.

We'll send you one more email once everything is complete, with your
new password and a summary of the migration.
