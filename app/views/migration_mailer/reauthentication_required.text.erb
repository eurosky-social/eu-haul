Re-authentication Required
=========================

Hello,

Your migration <%= @migration.token %> has been paused because a login session expired. To continue, you need to re-enter your password on the migration status page.

Account Details:
- Old Handle: @<%= @migration.old_handle %>
- New Handle: @<%= @migration.new_handle %>
- Failed Step: <%= @failed_step.to_s.gsub('Job', '').humanize %>

What You Need to Do:

1. Visit your migration status page:
   <%= @migration_url %>

2. Enter your password for @<%= @migration.old_handle %> to re-authenticate

3. The migration will continue automatically where it left off

YOUR DATA IS SAFE:
All migration progress has been preserved. You just need to re-authenticate so we can continue transferring your account.

---
Migration Token: <%= @migration.token %>
This email was sent to <%= @migration.email %> because you initiated an account migration.
